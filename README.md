# JsonSchema

Json Schema Generator is to describe the structure and validation constraints of your JSON documents. There are many json-schema validators, but only few generators. This library is intended to provide Ruby with an interface for validating JSON objects against a JSON schema conforming to JSON Draft7.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'json_schema'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:
